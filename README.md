## About me:

Welcome to my python portfolio! I am currently working as a Business Analyst at a media advertising agency but more importantly I am an aspiring data scientist. After graduating with a Bachelors in Business Administration I've made the realization of how powerful data science can be in making better-informed decisions. I've been using online resources to learn Python such as [Dataquest](https://www.dataquest.io/).  Below you will find my Data Science projects in descending order.

Feel free to contact me, make suggestions or propose new projects.
