# Journey to Becoming a Data Scientist
## About me:

My name is Jason Minhas and I'm currently working as a Business Analyst at a media advetising agency but more important I am an aspiring data scientist. After graduating with a Bachelors in Business Administration I've made the realization on powerful data science and analysis can be in making better-informed decisions.  In this repository you will find my Data Science projects.

Feel free to contact me, make suggestions or propose new projects.
